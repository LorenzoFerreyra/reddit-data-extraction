I have chronic pain and it's not uncommon for chronic pain patients to be told that our brains are still plastic and we should be able to retrain them so that we aren't in pain all the time. Aside from the fact that our brains are usually just responding to nerve signals from elsewhere in the body, we are told \"this IS possible, try it\" and often denied or limited access to medication to our pain in favour of \"thinking ourselves out of pain\" but there is never any real guidance on HOW to achieve this re-jigging of neural connections to stop ourselves from being in pain all the time. I assume that the reason there is no concrete method for how to do this is because no one actually knows, yet, a reliable way to do it that works for most people. Yet when we try and fail, the fault is with us. We didn't want it enough or we didn't try hard enough - and that's even more validation to limiting access to proven methods of pain relief. (I know that medications are not without their own risks.) Although I don't have experience with it, I wouldn't be surprised if similar things happen to people seeking treatment for certain mental health conditions. Rewire your brain so you aren't anxious. Reforge your neurons so that specific events no longer trigger panic in you. Every person suffering would LOVE to be able to ease what ails us by rewiring our brains - but simply telling people it is possible isn't enough to make it happen.\n\nThis criticism is not directed at OP.

I'm HPV-free (thank the gods!) but I've been sexually assaulted before, more than once unfortunately. So I figured I may as well err on the side of caution, especially with the direction of our country right now. \n\nI also had a partial hysterectomy (bilateral salpingectomy performed via laparoscope) last June bc my gut was telling me to do this before it was too late. I was lucky to have insurance cover the entire procedure, and also to have a badass OBGYN who never once asked what my husband thought about my decision to follow through with my surgery, especially bc I'm childfree (by choice). I was EXTRA lucky due to the fact that my OBGYN & second surgeon found & removed endometriosis tissue along with a few massive uterine fibroids, two of which were malignant. Thankfully they managed to excise all of the tissue & I had scans done in October to see if any growth has returned, but none has! My next check up is May 2nd, so I'm hoping my luck holds out, but I feel good about the odds. \n\nIf you've read all of this just know that my point to all of this was to say that thanks to you & others like you, I can live a (somewhat) easier life here in America as a person who possesses two XX chromosomes instead of XY.

People, mainly kids, started peeing a lot, and if they tasted the urine and it was sweet, they person would die. Basically what happens is that insulin carries sugar (glucose) from your blood stream into your cells. For some reason insulin being produced so the sugar stays in to blood stream where it circulates around unseated of being used by your cells for energy. The body senses the sugar build up and tries to pee it out, but this never works and the person gets dehydrated and dies.  \n\nThere is another kind of diabetes called \u201cdiabetes insipidus,\u201d which means insipid/not sweet urine, which is caused by a vitamin deficiency and has nothing to do with insulin or blood sugar. It\u2019s just has the similar symptom of causing person to pee excessively.  \n\nSo if you started peeing a lot and the doctor tasted your urine you and it was sweet it was a death sentence, if it was not sweet you could live and that\u2019s how it was for millennia. Until these two professor dudes wondered what would happen if you cut a pancreas out of a dog in the 1920\u2019s.  \n\nBack then people weren\u2019t sure what the pancreas actually did, so what the best way to find out? Find a dog, cut out the pancreas, and sow it back up then watch what happens. The dog died, but first it started peeing a lot. Hmm\u2026 must be related to diabetes. It\u2019s science do they needed repetition do they did this several (understatement) more times.  \n\nThe next step was to cut out the dog pancreases, grind them up and feed it back to them. The dogs still died but *not as fast*, they were on to something. Again, science, repetition etc. Let\u2019s just say you wouldn\u2019t want to be a dig in Toronto during this time.  \n\nSo they eventually got this pancreas slurry streamlined enough so they went to the hospital to find a patient to test. Type 1 diabetes is also known as \u201cjuvenile diabetes\u201d for a reason. They found a kid and went to the mom and asked if they could inject her son with their dog pancreas slurry to see if it would help; her son was dying anyway.  \n\nShe said okay, so they injected him. After that he got a pretty bad infection from it, but for a short time after, his diabetes symptoms went away.  \n\nThe professors went back to work, tweaked the slurry, went back to the mom and said sorry about the infection but they think they really have it figured out this time. She said okay again, and they injected the kid again, this time with pure insulin, and it worked!  \n\nWith repeated injections the kid became the first person ever to survive diabetes! The professors won the Nobel prize and gifted the formula for insulin to humanity because insulin shouldn\u2019t be expensive (we all know how that turned out). The kid somewhat became a celebrity and it made national news when he died as an adult years later. The professors never admitted how many dogs died in their experiments.  \n\nThe end.", "id": "t1_mloa5hi", "author": "Aeropro", "time": 1743930820.0, "parent": "t1_mln67gm"}, {"body": "Just imagine that they used to use pig insulin!", "id": "t1_mlnb6y1", "author": "Reinardd", "time": 1743911263.0, "parent": "t1_mln67gm"}, {"body": "\u201cStore bought is fine\u201d", "id": "t1_mlnsfss", "author": "whatsnewpussykat", "time": 1743919943.0, "parent": "t1_mln67gm"}, {"body": "I just looked it up, and synthetic insulin has been around for just 103 years, though of course not widely available at first.

I'll speak to my relevant field of antibodies, but often times you need to model protein-protein interactions which becomes much more complicated. A single structure alone is not helpful. And even when doing protein-protein interactions, it may not be the same in something like a model or an x-ray crystal structure as it is in-vivo at the cell surface. And there is heterogeneity in structures as many cell surface proteins also exist in multimeric forms, can be clipped, or may be occluded by steric hindrance due to the design of your antibody or even just it's inclusion as part of larger cell surface receptor arrangements like the TCR.\n\nThen theres also many hurdles that are not even science related. You are severely overestimating the capabilities of scientific institutions. Its sad, but there is a lot of really stupid people in high places just cashing in paychecks.

The mummified corpse was later identified as a human child.[3]\n\nIn 2017, Maussan appeared in a video hosted by Gaia, Inc. where a mummified body supposedly discovered in Peru near the Nazca lines claimed to be \"a three-fingered alien\" was unveiled.[3]\n\nA 2017 report by the Peruvian prosecutor\u2019s office stated that supposed alien bodies promoted by Maussan were actually \u201crecently manufactured dolls, which have been covered with a mixture of paper and synthetic glue to simulate the presence of skin.\u201d[4]\n\nOn 12 September 2023, Maussan unveiled two allegedly \"nonhuman beings\" to Mexico's first Congress of the Union public hearing regarding UFOs. Maussan claimed that these were mummified corpses found in a diatom mine in the city of Cusco, Peru near Nazca, and were believed to be more than 1,000 years old.[5][6] Maussan claimed that scientists at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) came to the conclusion that, in his words, the corpses are not \"part of our terrestrial evolution\" and that almost a third of their DNA is of \"unknown origin\",[7] however Julieta Fierro, physics researcher at UNAM, stated that the university never endorsed such claims and that Maussan's data \"made no sense.\"[8] UNAM further republished their September 2017 statement specifying that they did not make any conclusion as to the origins of a sample sent to them for carbon-14 testing and that no other kind of testing was performed by them.[9] Wired reported that \"mummies\" presented by Maussan are believed to be \"an elaborate hoax made of human and animal bones\".[10]\n\nIn November 2023, Maussan held a second presentation at the Mexican Congress regarding \"three-fingered Peruvian mummies\". Maussan claimed that they were \"not related to any life on Earth\". The presentation included the testimonies of a number of doctors who said the bodies were those of previously living organisms, presenting the remains as \"potential evidence of non-human life forms\", while \"declining to certify that the remains were extraterrestrial\". Anthropologist Roger Zuniga stated that \"there was absolutely no human intervention in the physical and biological formation of these beings\".[11] However, forensic archaeologist Flavio Estrada, who examined the specimens for the prosecutor's office of Peru, said, \"They are not extraterrestrials, they are not intraterrestrials, they are not a new species, they are not hybrids, they are none of those things that this group of pseudo-scientists who for six years have been presenting with these elements\", adding that the humanoid dolls consisted of animal and human bones assembled with synthetic glue.

You have the basics down, but it\u2019s way harder than that in practice lol. For one, exogenous mRNA induces an interferon response which reduces translation. The dose of mRNA required to have an effect is therefore significantly higher than it otherwise would be for an endogenous sequence, and that needs a lot of optimization. The final lipid nanoparticle complex (vehicle carrier of the mRNA) has something very important called an N:P ratio which is the molar ratio of amine groups of your ionizable/cationic lipid (lipid that actually binds to nucleic acids via electrostatic interaction) and protonatable phosphates on the mRNA. This ratio has to be optimized every time you introduce a new mRNA sequence, because the backbone length changes the phosphate content. If you change the molar amount of ionizable lipid, you need to change the molar amounts of other lipids in the vehicle. \n\nProtein engineering is complex. Knowing your antigen sequence is only part of the game. Because we are not translating an entire viral protein (would be kinda bad for cells and all), the truncated domain/sequence has to be altered to still yield a functional, properly folded protein on its own. What\u2019s more, the sequence has to be altered such that the protein 1) avoids degradation due to it being foreign to begin with 2) avoids degradation as a transcript by endogenous nucleases 3) is able to cross the plasma membrane and properly express on the cell surface, instead of being purely localized to the cytosol. \n\nI could go on and on, but the short of it is that the process is way more complex than you make it out to be, and at this time we are not in a place where we can just sequence an antigen and pop it into a lipid shell, ready to ship the next month.

But we don't because when you're just working on a vaccine for a disease that on the scale of humanity is \"mostly and inconvenience\" then your primary motivation is going to be cost. Even though you could overlap stage 2 and stage 3 tests, why would you do that when stage 2 might show that your vaccine doesn't actually work? In that scenario you've wasted all the money of the stage 3 tests.\n\nIn essence (and oversimplification) you can break down vaccine testing into four/five stages.\n\n * Stage 0: Non-human tests. These might be mouse models or petri dish setups. Basically \"Does this thing probably do what we want?\". You only pass if the right antibodies are made. (0 humans)\n\n * Stage 1: High level human safety tests. Basically \"If we inject a uselessly small amount of this, does our test group get sick?\" which extends upwards to injecting more appropriate amounts. You can also do an early check to see if there's any detectable antibodies produced. You only pass if there's no serious side effects and at least some antibodies are produced. (A few dozen humans.)\n\n * Stage 2: Limited-size combo safety/effective-dosage test. Basically \"Group A gets 1 portion size, Group B gets 2 portions, Group C gets 3 portions, and Group D gets 4 portions.\". The objective is both, figure out what's the MINIMUM amount of vaccine you can give and still be effective, and also check for safety. In that example, Group A might not have gotten enough vaccine to make a detectable amount of antibodies. Group B might have gotten enough and all was well. Group C might have gotten enough and all was well. Group D might have gotten enough, but also noted a lot of upset stomachs. In this situation, A is too little, D is too much, and what becomes the standard dosage will be somewhere between group's B and C depending on more specific data. (Ex: If B had 70% effectiveness and C had 95%, you might end up with a dose that was 2.6 portions in size.) (Several hundred, upwards of a thousand humans depending on funding.)\n\n * Stage 3: Broad-size combo safety/effectiveness test. Now that you know the effective safe dosage for the average human, you roll it out to a large number of people. If a problem is 1:10,000 with your vaccine, you probably wouldn't see it with the earlier stages. So this is to see if there are any problems on the medium scale deployment that might cause you to stop here.\n\n * Post-Release: Even large Stage-3 trials only have several tens of thousands of people. If you have a problem that is 1:100,000, you might not have seen it. So once you've released the vaccine for general application, you check in and see what health problems show up in the statistical analysis. For example, several COVID vaccines raised your natural rate of a particular kind of blood clot in your shoulder from about 6 people getting it out of 100,000, to about 9 people out of 100,000. These clots are as serious as any other clot, but as we're pretty good at dealing with them, this isn't a show-stopper. Particularly since \"A 0.003% chance of getting a blood clot we can treat\" is not serious next to \"A >3% chance of dying to a respiratory disease\".\n\nSo how does this relate back to the COVID vaccine schedule?\n\n * Stage 0 tests had to fully conclude before stage 1 could start, let's say the tests normally take a month to do, then because the FDA and similar address paperwork \"first in, first out\" you then wait another month or two for them to give you the thumbs up. But with emergency measures put in place, COVID paperwork was IMMEDIATELY seen instead of waiting in the queue. It still was examined with all the normal rigor, but you got an answer in days instead of months.\n\n * Stage 1 tests can take upwards of two or three months (if the antibodies happen to show up earlier, the test can go faster, because your risk factors are associated with the amount of antibodies) to conclude, however, 4-6 weeks in, you see everybody is fine and you can detect some antibodies then with permission and extra precautions you can immediately start Stage 2 while Stage 1 is progressing. But if something comes up like in month 3 suddenly everyone dies, or for whatever reason the paperwork fails, then immediately Stage 2 is halted. And again, the paperwork is first-in-line.\n\n * Stage 2 tests take about as long as Stage 1. They are more expensive because there's more people involved, and more lab-work (you're periodically taking blood and other samples from everyone to see what's going on.). Again, you'll actually have a pretty good idea of the dose levels you need and the effectiveness with regards to antibody production long before the test actually finishes. So once you have that data and get permission, you can start Stage 3. Again, paperwork is front of the line and if Stage 2 fails, Stage 3 is halted.\n\n * Stage 3 tests take about as long as the other stages did, but are REALLY expensive because lots more people and still more lab-work. You won't get permission to actually administer the vaccine to anybody in the public yet, but you can start production because you have a good idea that you aren't going to have to throw it all away. And again, paperwork is front of the line.\n\n * Post-release...well, you can only ever collect this after you passed everything else and got permission to inject people.\n\nSo you can partially overlap Stages 1, 2, and 3 to save on time (but you increase your financial risk that something might go wrong and you wasted effort/money), and paperwork time was eliminated because the paperwork was always at the front of the queue.\n\nNow, there's also a provisional sort of approval which can be given (this is true even for vaccines produced in a normal schedule) where the result is \"Your vaccine is MOSTLY safe, but has some noted problems. However, because the disease in question is worse, we are allowing you to produce and distribute this, but the instant there's a vaccine that does the same thing with fewer problems, your approval is revoked.\".\n\nTLDR: They still did all the same testing, they just took a financial risk by overlapping it.

They're structure, they're transport for other substances, they're in signalling pathways. Collagen and hemoglobin and insulin. They're part of *everything.*\n\nPractically speaking, a protein is a chain of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. There's 20 different aminos that can link in this way, and each of them has a different steric outline: the way the actual electromagnetic forces of the molecules involved allow it to fit together with anything else nearby. That means that any given chain of aminos will take a different shape, depending on its sequence, and the shapes they take, the way they're \"folded\", is almost always what determines their specific function. In many cellular-level processes, it's very close to a \"lock and key\" situation: a specifically shaped protein causes an effect in the cell because it is shaped to fit into a particular part of the cell, and the more proteins present in the cell body means a higher likelyhood that one of the right shape will bounce into the right space, and \"unlock\" the corresponding action.\n\nSeems simple enough. The problem is the scale of differences. We know the actual folded structure of about 100k proteins. We know the sequence of *billions* of different proteins. So we know they exist, and *where* they exist, but not exactly what they do or how they do it.\n\nThis is because the shapes proteins take are the result of mostly-stochastic action across millions of years of evolution. Randomly bouncing around until something works, and that something works in a way that allows better bouncing, ad infinitum. We could never, on our own, catch up.\n\nSo what AlphaFold does seems very simple, but it's an absolute gamechanger: it models *possible* folds for any given amino sequence, and then models its potential interactions with other proteins and structures, orders of magnitude faster than any human can alone. Going back to the lock and key analogy: it's like we have a lock, and we have been painstakingly both trying all the keys we have and sometimes trying to make new ones, all by hand. AlphaFold is something like a machine that can make dozens of keys a second, and try them on the lock, until it finds the right one. Then, perhaps even more importantly, it tells us specifically *how it made the key,* which means we now both know what that key does, and how to make more of that key.\n\nMost of the operation of an organic body has been behind those locks. AlphaFold is already printing new, functional keys for us at an incredible rate. We won't start seeing the results in practice for a while yet, that's always how science does.

I'm actually somewhere adjacent to AI development, and part of me is always going to be *burning* with rage that a field that has been worked on for decades was only able to really take off when it privatized, and what people seem to have taken from that is that privatization is the only thing that works, not that if academic labs had been getting more resources to begin with, we wouldn't have to deal with the associated ethical clusterfucks privatizing it has brought.\n\nThe reason I mentioned 2 as my \"gamechanger\" of choice isn't so much that it, by itself, is going to lead to tremendous developments. It's that it was a *fairly* powerful tool that was released, weights included, for free, and can run locally. So not only has basically any lab that could benefit from it been bootstrapped ahead by being able to just *have* it, it's also set a precedent for the use of AI as specialized research tools, and as a publically available common resource. By greatly expanding the number of labs that have access to this tool, we've increased the field of probabilities that *one* of them will use it to crack something big. Or, indeed, that one of them will make a more specialized version based on the specific way they've been using it, and make *that* publically available.\n\nThat's also why I didn't mention 3. I am *not pleased* with how Isomorphic has handled it, and I am not mollified that they've come around somewhat.

The reason is that the botox means they don't smile as much, so their brains basically say, \"Huh, I'm not smiling. I must be sad about something\" and that literally *causes depression*. \n\nAnother example is that if you do something nice for someone you will like them more. Your brain observes you doing a favour for someone and says, \"Well, I'm doing something nice for this guy so logically I must like him\". \n\nIn fact, you will probably like them even more than if they did something nice for you.

I'll take your question in good faith. \n\n**TLDR: Foreign aid helps people, saves money, boosts America's reputation, keeps Americans safer, and ensures the US stays influential globally**\n\n**Firstly, it's just the right thing to do.** I don't know if you're the praying kind (I'm not) but in a global village, foreign aid aligns with values like \"love thy neighbor\" or \"Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.\" (Matthew 25:37-40).\n\n**Second, more tangible facts: think about this as prevention.**[Prevention is shown to be more cost-effective than needing to invest in ongoing treatment](https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2020/february/20200224_gow_investments) \n\n>\"[...]under the Fast-Track approach\u2014whereby a high upfront investment leads to large reductions in new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths\u2014**each dollar invested brings up to US$ 6.44 of economic returns in low- and middle-income countries**. Even under a more conservative constant-coverage scenario\u2014whereby investment is such that coverage of HIV-related services were kept constant at 2015 levels and new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths don\u2019t fall\u2014the economic return on each dollar is still positive, at US$ 2.55 in low- and middle-income countries.\"\n\n**Third, it's great advertising and goodwill for the United States.**   [People are aware of who helps them, whether it is health care workers, or those they're treating](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/15/opinion/foreign-aid-cuts-impact.html). \n\n>Village leaders assembled under a giant tree outside to show their appreciation. \u201cWe want to thank you,\u201d said the town\u2019s chief, James Garang Deng. \u201cWomen are safe here now.\u201d **Everyone then cheered America\u2019s generosity**.\n\n**Fourth point, national security**. Yes, security. We all remember five years ago, how fast COVID-19 took laps around the world. We failed to nip that in the bud, and now we'll have to live with it. Some may recall the Ebola scare or Zika virus before that. Heck the AIDS crisis in the US took its toll. But again, we can fix that now. \n\nAlso, overlapping with the previous point, if The United States can position itself as a friend, supporter and partner, it will be safer. [As stated under George W Bush and the National Security Council](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/nsc/nssall.html)\n\n>We will:  \n&nbsp;  \n\u2022 use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;   \n&nbsp;  \n[...] Today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America\u2019s borders have a greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas, and goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish\u2014our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life\u2014are vulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we bring to justice those responsible for the September 11 attacks.\n\n**Final point: the void left by USAID weakens American soft power.**\nNamely, China is already allocating foreign aid money in Africa to build its influence. Now, without the US there to promote democracy and counter terrorism, the Chinese influence will likely grow. [It can position itself as a reliable partner](https://fortune.com/asia/2025/03/26/china-swoops-in-to-replace-asian-usaid-projects-axed-by-trump/).\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s a diplomatic gift\u201d to China, said Charles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. \u201cIn every country where there\u2019s a serious USAID cut, if they put a small amount of money into a health and education project and say, \u2018Look, we\u2019re ramping up,\u2019 that does seem to be a bit of a publicity gift for them. And I\u2019m sure they\u2019re smart enough to take it.\u201d\n\nIf, after reading all this, you still have questions, check out the NY Times article. It has more facts and data and stories, and makes some good points.\n\nOne final thing: Foreign aid alone isn't sufficient. We need countries to build good/stable/democratic governance, reliable infrastructure, access to education and of course health care...It *is* part of a bigger puzzle though. If we can tackle that puzzle with our hearts and minds in the right place, it looks like we can solve it without feeling like we're losing money and power \u2014 at home and abroad. \n\nIt's like insurance.

It's basically filling in for the sphincter that's supposed to be doing this job.\n\nThe woman I was dating originally discovered it at a scientific conference where a product called Reflux Gourmet was being presented, which is alginate in the form of an edible paste. I used this for a while but disliked it because they added a ton of sugar, which I don't think was particularly healthy and I think exacerbated the reflux when the barrier wore off.\n\nI have since switched to [this product](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZDJ1MSK?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) which has been wonderful. I take two capsules after every meal and immediately before bed.\n\nI prefer this to PPIs because in the past, I suffered some pretty awful brain fog from PPIs, which I suspect was due to decreased magnesium absorption due to the reduced acidity in my stomach.

For us, the entanglement is \u201cone line is across from the other\u201d). Then, spin the top (project the two particles forward in time. It becomes unclear which is which now, since time has passed, so things become probabilistic again).\n\nWhile it\u2019s spinning, the two lines should blend together (the wavefunctions will become probabilistic again). It should be practically impossible to track any one of the two lines. You know they\u2019re there, but you have no idea exactly where\u2014just that they are there, and that one is across from the other (the two particles\u2019 states are still entangled, despite being probabilistic).\n\nNow, think about what happens if you try to grab one side of the top so it stops spinning (collapse the wavefunction).

So, grab the top.\n\nIf you grab it, and see you\u2019re closest to the red side, call it that you\u2019ve located the red-named particle.

She was just dismissive of it and even said she didn't bother reading the whole thing, or getting a rough translation of the actual papers. I know this because she repeats several of the news article lies/falsehoods that don't exist in the paper. For example, the glaring math error (English 'news' says 2k, but the columns are only 650~m deep) she didn't catch that or point it out, calling them 'Houses' and the 'support structure for the pyramid itself' is completely made up and doesn't appear in the paper or talk.\n\nShe also only went off whatever news article had for images and not the paper itself which had more scans (where you can kinda see where the 3d model thats being thrown around comes from). She then attacks the researchers characters instead of addressing the claims which is a Ad Hominem logical fallacy (plus the alien guy on the team isn't one of the alien guys that believe the pyramids were built by aliens, but thats a whole different crazy-person story). She was just as dismissive as she always is.\n\nMetatron's video is significantly better, being a native Italian speaker (and honestly, the only person who speaks and reads Italian to talk on this afaik) going through both the Alien conference announcement (red flag, pretty big one tbh) and the paper and associated papers about their claimed SAR data analysis technique. It doesn't come at it from any entrenched viewpoints and just translates out the information. If anything he has a bit of wonderment about it as we all should until its proven false.\n\nThe only sensible response is: Repeat the scan. Get scans of other locations and prove it can scan more than 10m deep (and not just from that research facility 20m down that revealed unmarked rooms). Have other research teams go at it.\n\nIts also worth noting their other papers have far better scan targets revealing information we didn't know about/available info about locations that have been confirmed true deeper than 10m. The Pyramid scan they admit is lacking data, since they were only allowed one pass and their technique needs many, the more the better. (side note, also explains why there are 5 'houses' in odd locations and potentially the columns + base is doubled. The other scans are much, much cleaner, this one has a ton of noise and is from a limited scan.)\n\nWe either have a massive leap in technology, or someone just trying to get more government funding.

I'm just a nerd with a passion for science.  A lot of it depends on fucky atomic physics stuff.\n\nBasically, proteins work by having 'receptor sites' that interact with specific molecules.  They do this through a combination of mechanical (the molecule literally 'fits' with another one the right way) and atomic-force and electropositivity bullshit; it's a lot more complicated than simple bonds.  Imagine you've got a puzzle piece that fits with another, but there're magnets dotted around the piece and the puzzle where it's supposed to fit.  A piece the same shape but with the wrong orientation of magnets won't 'key' into the receptor site the same way that one with the right orientation of magnets would.\n\nIt gets even more complex with proteins that can change their shape as they do their job, doing things like latching onto two molecules and then bringing them together.\n\nOnce you know a protein's structure you can predict how it will behave and what it will bond with, by examining those sites and computing forces and stuff.  (Of course, other molecules can fit that shouldn't -- which is how a lot of poisons work.)  You'll probably also take into account the potential inputs and outputs that it could be exposed to, which will help narrow things down.  That's the starting point to *really* engineer things.  Say you've got a protein that's attacked by another poison that fits in and poisons the receptor site.  Well, maybe by changing the structure slightly, you can engineer that receptor to still merge with its intended target but reject the poison.  Or you could modify a protein to bond with that protein much more preferentially than with the important, previously-targetted protein to act as an antitoxin.\n\nWhen you combine that with CRISPr, which allows you to *build* proteins rapidly, well, now you're cooking with gas.", "id": "t1_mlozrtr", "author": "PraxicalExperience", "time": 1743944970.0, "parent": "t1_mlnkx3m"}, {"body": "Yeah, he needed to sue them to actually get a decent amount of money, which I'd argue still isn't enough for how big of an invention it actually is.", "id": "t1_mlnzs6a", "author": "burf12345", "time": 1743924141.0, "parent": "t1_mlnwd8z"}, {"body": "And his lawyers got most of it.", "id": "t1_mlo024n", "author": "yeerk_slayer", "time": 1743924311.0, "parent": "t1_mlnwd8z"}, {"body": "According to Wikipedia, that was only enough to cover his legal expenses.

The main mechanism is that blue light stimulates the secretion of melatonin in pineal gland which can increase or decrease cortisol expression depending on time of day and regulate human circadian rhythm[37]\u2013[39]. There were researchers have investigate the sleep quality found that after cataract surgery the sleep quality of old people have improved to some extent, the reason is that transparent artificial crystal allow more blue light penetrate to reach the eye[40] and thus confirmed that blue light can regulate the circadian rhythm. However, if blue light is excessive, especially at night when melatonin production peaks, it can not only damage the retina through the ocular surface, but can also stimulate the brain, inhibit melatonin secretion, and increase corticosteroid production, thereby destroying hormonal secretion and directly affecting sleep quality[38]. As recently as ten years ago, some scholars suggested that a variety of sleep disorders appear to be closely related to visual impairment, suggesting that sleep quality is related to eye diseases[41]. Sleep disorders cause an increase in corticosteroid production[38], which can reduce parasympathetic nerve excitability and reduce tear secretion, thus causing the occurrence of dry eyes. At the same time, blue light-induced sleep disorders cause a reduction in eye closing time, and after a longer period of time, open eyes will cause an increase in tear evaporation thus leading to dry eye symptoms. In addition, some studies have shown that lack of sleep can reduce the body's androgen levels[42]. There have been a large number of studies that have shown that the lack of androgens can lead to the dysfunction of the eyelid's gland function, thus reducing the lacrimal lipid layer's secretions and leading to the occurrence of excessive evaporation of dry eyes[42]\u2013[43].", "id": "t1_mlorxcv", "author": "Loud_Interview4681", "time": 1743941410.0, "parent": "t1_mlornc4"}, {"body": "Talk to your dentist.

So I\u2019m looking at what people say the \u201cCopenhagen interpretation\u201d is and it ticked me off that that phrase isn\u2019t even well-defined, which is a little odd. Alright, so I look further.\n\nThe Copenhagen interpretation has elements of believing in stuff like the Born rule, like uncertainty principles, and like wavefunctions collapsing. These things are, to be honest, kind of indispensable to quantum mechanics as an idea. I say \u201ckind of\u201d because the actual theory has room for interpretation, but the basic ideas introduced are pretty integral.\n\nAn aside on the term \u201cwavefunction\u201d: it is a mathematical object we use, most often with units [m^(-1)], to parameterize particles based on positions and times. These wavefunctions exist in the complex plane (they have a real and an imaginary part, or more fittingly, a magnitude and a phase), and when we take the complex square (find their magnitude in our, real-valued world) of them, it tells us the chance we find a particle based on its location (and much more).\n\nThe Born rule states that, if we integrate the complex square (the magnitude) of a wavefunction across all relevant space, we will get the probability a particle exists anywhere as a function of location. For instance, if we trapped a particle inside a box, the Born rule should be used to show us that the particle only has probabilities > 0% of existing inside the box, and nowhere else. It\u2019s kind of essential to doing any calculations in quantum mechanics. So doing away with it isn\u2019t really viable.\n\nUncertainty principles, another facet of \u201cthe Copenhagen interpretation\u201d, aren\u2019t even quantum mechanical ideas. They\u2019re actually derived from linear algebra and statistical mechanics. It\u2019s heavy math to understand where they come from that requires you probably take the class Abstract Algebra or a big quantum class, but again, these aren\u2019t quantum: they\u2019re actually just baked into the math. So, again, kinda indispensable.\n\nWavefunction collapse. Alright. This is the big one, since this is the one that actually has room for different interpretations. The answer: we don\u2019t know lol. That\u2019s why theories like the many worlds theory exists, because we don\u2019t know.\n\nAs a small aside, it\u2019s extremely dangerous in STEM and humanities subjects alike to try and think about what\u2019s objectively correct. I don\u2019t like to do that, since all I find it does is lock people into their own thought boxes. As a thought experiment, I ask you to ask yourself, \u201cwhat does it mean to be objectively correct?\u201d I imagine if I asked every person this question, they\u2019d all have a slightly different answer, which means that the concept of objectivity is subjective, which is a paradox, no?\n\nSo again, theories aren\u2019t correct. Theories are well-accepted, debated, and/or not well-accepted. In rare cases, we may find evidence that proves it is genuinely how the universe works, which is when it becomes law. We do not know enough about quantum mechanics as a community to make any claims on what\u2019s correct and what\u2019s not yet.

After a year and a half of horrific bullying that would later result in a diagnosis of PTSD when I was 20, I attempted suicide for the first time. It was my most successful attempt too, as by all accounts I was lifeless for at least a minute. My mother found me hanging from a scarf in my room and brought me back to life right there. Death itself is painless, coming back hurts like all hell. Air gets forced back in your lungs, your nerves turning back on feels like electricity and full body pins-and-needles, muscles spasm... \n\nBut the worst pain? The worst pain came from feeling my mother trembling as she held me when I came back. She held me so tight, and I could feel her trembling. I could hear her screaming and crying from having almost lost me. Nothing was ever really the same after that. The world lost some of its vibrant color, became a bit more gray. Part of me didn't come back from where I went.\n\nDon't feel too bad for me though. Once that school year ended, we moved to a new school district. One that was rated as being one of the best in the state, if not the country. I got help, help for severe depression and numerous other issues I had. I made friends, friends who recognized the pain I was in even when I couldn't put it to words. In 2019, I graduated from my high school with honors. Not bad for someone who died in 2008. \n\nThat said, my childhood was over after that. From 2008 onwards, I found myself in this strange limbo. I didn't do the normal childhood things.

It hit me really hard and I honestly hadn\u2019t thought about the implications of a full time job taking that freedom away from me. \n\nFor anyone out there that thinks they should quit education and go get any type of shitty full time job, please think twice. You have the rest of your life to work a full time job and at least do it with a job you could potentially enjoy once qualified. I ended up going back into education in order to join a trade that I enjoyed. Short term pain (financially) looonnnggg term gain (job satisfaction)\n\nTo add context and experience to this also. If you go work in a shitty factory for a bang average wage with limited qualifications, expect management to treat you like an uneducated moron! They will never take you seriously and could take advantage. \n\nSince applying myself and gaining additional qualifications, I haven\u2019t looked back. Obviously things aren\u2019t perfect but I do look back to my factory job and wonder how long I would\u2019ve lasted until blowing my brains out.\n\nHope this helps anyone who is currently at a crossroad \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb", "id": "t1_mlo0g4t", "author": "JeffreyNasty24", "time": 1743924557.0, "parent": "t3_1jsmu4t"}, {"body": "It ended when me and my cousins were playing in my parents backyard and we kept looking around to see if anyone were looking at us.", "id": "t1_mlo0hyr", "author": "Mezmodian", "time": 1743924590.0, "parent": "t3_1jsmu4t"}, {"body": "When I stopped watching cartoons on a regular basis and never bought any action figures again.

She would give me giant lists of chores to keep me from doing something stupid while I was alone.  Some of the chores were clearly busy work (wash the stairs by hand, pick up all the sticks in the yard) and she had me doing things I probably shouldn\u2019t have been doing so young (mowing the lawn, shoveling the entire driveway myself) and I would be in big trouble if I didn\u2019t get everything done before she got home.  I had older siblings, but they mostly lived at their boyfriend\u2019s houses during this time.  Looking back, it feels like I had taken on the role of my mom\u2019s spouse in a way.  After the divorce, she had multiple relationships and marriages (once married the father of one of my classmates and my classmate turned step-brother ended up sexually assaulting me when I was 15, but I didn\u2019t tell because my mom would express her feelings of upset as anger towards me so I always felt like I did something wrong.  She also married a woman at one point because she hated men, but then she broke that poor woman\u2019s heart because turns out Mom isn\u2019t a lesbian- oops!).  Every time she had a breakup or a fight with a boyfriend, she would come crying to me and I was supposed to hug her and comfort her and it was so uncomfortable for me.  So, I definitely feel like it was one of those early years after the divorce where I felt like I was sort of on my own where my childhood ended. I still had a great childhood in other ways and my mom was lovely in many ways, but she definitely made me grow up too fast and I have a lot of residual trauma and resentment towards both of my parents.", "id": "t1_mlozynf", "author": "Sharp-Pollution4179", "time": 1743945049.0, "parent": "t3_1jsmu4t"}, {"body": "The second I could hold the bottle, I became a man.", "id": "t1_mlp6tsb", "author": "GlitteringBicycle172", "time": 1743947699.0, "parent": "t3_1jsmu4t"}, {"body": "noo frr it sucked", "id": "t1_mlnohqj", "author": "Infinite_Bass2478", "time": 1743917770.0, "parent": "t3_1jsmu4t"}, {"body": "When I turned 18", "id": "t1_mlnojb4", "author": "Humble-Lake71", "time": 1743917795.0, "parent": "t3_1jsmu4t"}, {"body": "Bloody hell (literally).", "id": "t1_mlo2jdk", "author": "WhosThatDogMrPB", "time": 1743925879.0, "parent": "t1_mlntmbp"}, {"body": "Well that's a crushing combo", "id": "t1_mlo27tr", "author": "Visual-Routine-809", "time": 1743925677.0, "parent": "t1_mlntmbp"}, {"body": "Oof.

I personally hate when someone ask me if I'm hurt or if I liked it.\n I have a whole conversation before hand about how I will be and what I will say if I need them to stop. It's even worse if we do it multiple times and they still ask, as if I didn't go over it again. (Like I will explain as best as I can and as detailed as possible, that they will know if I like it, unless your trying to make me laugh don't talk to me during sex. Of course you have the ones who want to do sexy talk, and it's rarely ever sexy to me. I just get distracted from the feeling and then disappointed, because now I'm less horny).\nIt's not reassuring to ask those when trying to go for another time, from what I have observed. it's lack of confidence, it's not believing me, it's not listening to me half the time. I've even straight out had a few people tell me they didn't believe me because other people they have been with said things and it didn't turn out that way.
